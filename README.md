# CMExam

## Introduction

CMExam is a dataset sourced from the Chinese National Medical Licensing Examination. It consists of 60K+ multiple-choice questions and five additional question-wise annotations, including disease groups, clinical departments, medical disciplines, areas of competency, and question difficulty levels. Alongside the dataset, comprehensive benchmarks were conducted on representative LLMs on CMExam.
